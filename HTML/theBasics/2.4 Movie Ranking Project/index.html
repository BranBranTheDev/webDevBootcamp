<h1>The Best Movies Accoridng to Brandon Rivera</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>This is one of my top favorite movies, as it brings all of my favorite heros together in one action packed film</p>

<h3>Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby</h3>
<p>This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen by far, I could rewatch this and never get tired of it</p>

<h3>Coco</h3>
<p>What makes Coco in my top 3 is the story that is foretold in the movie, as it is inspired by Mexican culture.<br /> This is a well made movie that brings the art of marachi music and 
family together</p>
